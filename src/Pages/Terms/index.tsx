            <h3>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <h4>Changes to Services</h4>
            <p>If a client alters a service significantly after finalizing the agreement, Greyzone Consulting can adjust the price, modify delivery time, or decline to perform the service. In case of service refusal, the client will be charged for work already done.</p>
            <h4>Cancellation of Services</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Full Refund for Erroneous Payment:
                <ul>
                  <li>If you have made an erroneous payment, we offer a full refund, minus a 5% processing fee.</li>
                  <li>To be eligible for a refund, you must not have had any contact with Greyzone Consulting, and a refund request must be sent within 24 hours of the transaction.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Partially Paid and Unperformed Service Cancellation: If you decide to cancel a partially paid service that has not been performed, we offer a 70% refund.</li>
              <li>If a client cancels a service, Greyzone Consulting can claim payment for work done and research hours for the remainder of the service. If Greyzone Consulting set aside time for the service, the client may be charged 50% of the fee for the unperformed part of the work.</li>
              <li>If you decide to cancel a service provided by Greyzone Consulting after work has been completed, no refund can be issued, regardless of the outcome or results obtained.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Please note that once work has been performed and the necessary documentation and agreement have been provided, Greyzone Consulting has fulfilled its obligations, and refunds are no longer applicable.</p>

            <h4>Pricing & Payment</h4>
            <p>Prices are applicable to services that meet agreed specifications. Extra costs or work, due to reasons like unclear specifications or faulty files, may cause a price increase. Full payment is due prior to work commencement or as agreed by Greyzone Consulting.</p>

            <h4>Greyzone Consulting Cancellations</h4>
            <p>The agreement remains valid until services are completed or if the relationship terminates under certain conditions, like the client not providing required documentation within 30 days or Greyzone Consulting unable to contact the client for 15 days. Misleading information, failure to pay, and withholding information may also lead to contract termination without refund.</p>
            <p>We recommend clients to reach out to us if they experience any issues with our services.</p>

            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
