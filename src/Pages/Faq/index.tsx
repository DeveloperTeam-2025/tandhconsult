            <h2 className={classNames(`${styles.wp_block_heading} ${styles.has_medium_font_size}`)}>What Is the Process of a Cryptocurrency Investigation?</h2>
            <p className={styles.has_medium_font_size}>

            <h2 className={classNames(`${styles.wp_block_heading} ${styles.has_medium_font_size}`)}>Why Should I Hire a Specialized Provider for Cryptocurrency Investigations?</h2>

            <p className={styles.has_medium_font_size}>
              When it comes to lost or stolen digital assets, a cryptocurrency investigation can often be a crucial step.

              Is It Possible to Trace and Recover Lost Cryptocurrency Assets? How Can T&amp;H Consulting Assist, and What Are the Odds of Successful Recovery?
            </h2>
            <p className={styles.has_medium_font_size}>
              Yes, it is indeed possible to trace and recover lost cryptocurrency assets, in a manner akin to other stolen currencies, goods, or assets—usually via agreement, law enforcement intervention, or civil litigation. It’s important to note, however, that T&amp;H Consulting is not a recovery agency. Instead, we specialize in conducting thorough investigations and providing expert consultation services. Our comprehensive approach, which leverages data from various sources, aims to aid the recovery process led by the appropriate authorities or legal entities. While we can’t guarantee recovery, our mission is to significantly enhance the likelihood of successfully reclaiming lost assets.
            </p>

            <h2 className={classNames(`${styles.wp_block_heading} ${styles.has_medium_font_size}`)}>Is It Obligatory to Go to the Law Enforcement If I Lost Crypto?</h2>
            <p className={styles.has_medium_font_size}>
              We highly recommend you to report the loss to law enforcement in your jurisdiction and file a report, which will include the documentation we have prepared for you. This is an essential step in the recovery process and in seeking justice for yourself and other victims.
            </p>

            <h2 className={classNames(`${styles.wp_block_heading} ${styles.has_medium_font_size}`)}>Why Do I Need a Cryptocurrency Report?</h2>
            <p className={styles.has_medium_font_size}>
              A Cryptocurrency report contains detailed information about the movement of your lost or stolen cryptocurrency. This information is vital for law enforcement agents in their investigation and can help establish responsibility for the crime and aid in the recovery of your funds.

            <h2 className={classNames(`${styles.wp_block_heading} ${styles.has_medium_font_size}`)}>How Does T&amp;H Consulting Handle Crypto Cases?</h2>

            <h2 className={classNames(`${styles.wp_block_heading} ${styles.has_medium_font_size}`)}>Why No Free Plan?</h2>
            <p className={styles.has_medium_font_size}>
              “Free” services nearly always come with a hidden cost, such as the diversion of resources or the impact on the quality of service for paid clients. At T&amp;H Consulting, we value transparency and do not operate in this manner.
            </p>

            <h2 className={classNames(`${styles.wp_block_heading} ${styles.has_medium_font_size}`)}>Why Don’t You Bill Me at the End of the Process?</h2>
            <p className={styles.has_medium_font_size}>
              At T&amp;H Consulting, we believe in being upfront with our pricing, which is determined by the complexity of your case.
